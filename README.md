Medication Notification App
Medication Notification App: An Android app showcasing my skills in alarm scheduling, database integration, and user-centric design for medication reminders.
Users can add details of their medication including name, dosage and time they need to take the medication and choose to set an alert - a notification - at the time they provided with a compact alert with the medication name and dosage linking them back to the app.
This is to serve as a reminder to take medications on time, particularly for time sensetive medications.
Users add a new medication using the floating action button on the MainActivity and can edit an existing entry by selecting the option from the recycler view that populates the MainActivity. Both adding a new medication and editing an existing medication is done through the AddAlarmActivity.
Data is save to a persistent room database on the device, no data is stored online.
